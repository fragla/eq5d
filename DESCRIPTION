Description: EQ-5D is a popular health related quality of life instrument used 
    in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care. Developed by the 
    EuroQol group <https://euroqol.org/>, the instrument consists of two 
    components: health state description and evaluation. For the description 
    component a subject self-rates their health in terms of five dimensions; 
    mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
    anxiety/depression using either a three-level (EQ-5D-3L,
    <https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-3l-about/>) or a five-level
    (EQ-5D-5L, <https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-5l-about/>) 
    scale. Frequently the scores on these five dimensions are converted to a 
    single utility index using country specific value sets, which can be used
    in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in 
    population health surveys. The eq5d package provides methods to calculate 
    index scores from a subject's dimension scores. 29 TTO and 11 VAS EQ-5D-3L
    value sets including those for countries in Szende et al (2007) 
    <doi:10.1007/1-4020-5511-0> and Szende et al (2014) 
    <doi:10.1007/978-94-007-7596-1>, 35 EQ-5D-5L EQ-VT value sets from the 
    EuroQol website, the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk value sets developed by 
    van Hout et al. (2012) <doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008>, the
    crosswalk value set for Russia and reverse crosswalk value sets. Four 
    EQ-5D-Y value sets are also included as are the NICE 'DSU' age-sex
    based EQ-5D-3L to EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-5L to EQ-5D-3L mappings. Methods are 
    also included for the analysis of EQ-5D profiles along with a shiny web 
    tool to enable the calculation, visualisation and automated statistical 
    analysis of EQ-5D data via a web browser using EQ-5D dimension scores 
    stored in CSV or Excel files.
